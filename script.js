//Functions
//A function is a piece of code that we can reuse over and over again,
//and does one thing... it has a function to fullfill
function logger() {
  console.log("my name is jerome");
}

//when you use the function, you write its name with ()
//it's called running, calling, invoquing the function
logger();
logger();
logger();

//functions are like machines, you give them something and they return something back
//whats inside the () are called parameters, they have it
//BUT parameters being sent to functions are called arguments
//They are the same thing but parameters come out of the func and arguments are sent to the func
//parameters are like empty spaces that we need to fill out
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  console.log(apples, oranges);
  const juice = `the juice has ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges`;
  return juice;
}

//here we send the arguments 2 and 5 to the parameters called apples and oranges
fruitProcessor(2, 5);
//to be able to use the returned values, we first must store it in a var
const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(appleJuice);

const appleOrangeJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 5);
console.log(appleOrangeJuice);


//Arrow Functions
//the advantage of an arrow func is the return is done implicitly,
//we dont have to write the word return
//they also dont get a this keyword
//It is good for one liner functions
//here we assign the arrow function to the var calcAge3
//which is also the name of the function in a way
//parameter => what we want to return
const calcAge3 = (birthYear) => 2024 - birthYear;
const age3 = calcAge3(1986);

//the return can be omited in an arrow function only if it's a one liner
//that is not the case here
// const yearsUntilRetirement = (birthYear) => {
//   const age = 2024 - birthYear;
//   const retirement = 65 - age;
//   return retirement;
// };

//again, the var we assigned the arrow function to,
//is kinda the name of the function and how we call the argument
//yearsUntilRetirement(1991);

//when we have several parameters, we wrap it with ()
const yearsUntilRetirement = (birthYear, firstName) => {
  const age = 2024 - birthYear;
  const retirement = 65 - age;
  return `${firstName} retires in ${retirement} years`;
};

//we seperate arguments with ,
console.log(yearsUntilRetirement(1986, "jerome"));
console.log(yearsUntilRetirement(1956, "sam"));

//Reviewing Functions

const yearsUntilRetirement = function (birthYear, firstName) {
