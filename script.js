//They are the same thing but parameters come out of the func and arguments are sent to the func
//parameters are like empty spaces that we need to fill out

//the advantage of an arrow func is the return is done implicitly,

//which is also the name of the function in a way
//parameter => what we want to return

//   const retirement = 65 - age;
//   return retirement;

//is kinda the name of the function and how we call the argument
